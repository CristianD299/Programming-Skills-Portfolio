# Programming Skills Portfolio

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains solutions to a series of C++ programming exercises designed to strengthen fundamental programming skills. These exercises were completed as part of the **CodeLab I module** and cover basic concepts such as input/output, loops, conditionals, and arrays.

## 📂 Folder Structure
Each exercise is organized into its own folder inside the `ProgrammingSkillsPortfolio` directory:
```
ProgrammingSkillsPortfolio/
    01-CodingIsCool/
    02-SimpleSums/
    03-Biography/
    04-PrimitiveQuiz/
    05-DaysOfTheMonth/
    06-BruteForceAttack/
    07-SomeCounting/
    08-SimpleSearch/
    09-Hello/
    10-IsItEven/
```
Each folder contains a `main.cpp` file with the solution.

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the desired exercise folder.
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o program
   ```
3. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./program
   ```
